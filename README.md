Task application with next logic:

User is able to:

register in system
login into system
add new task
edit task
delete task
share task (share using email of another user in the system who will be also able to manage task afterwards )
see list of tasks ( list should auto-update when someone shares tasks with user; in the list user should see who has shared task)

Twitter Bootstrap was used for UI. Some Rspec test were written.
